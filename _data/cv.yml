experience:
  - name: MyAccount and Core team
    client: DAZN (via 101 Ways)
    from: Mar 2018
    to: Ongoing
    statement:
      - >
        As a Senior React Developer, I worked with a 4 developer team to build the
        MyAccount section of DAZNs rebuilt streaming platform. In building MyAccount
        I quickly got up to speed with modern JS frameworks the DAZN team used, MobX
        and MobX-state-tree for state management and React.
      - >
        I took the lead on building a library that integrated MobX with React-router,
        allowing the teams in DAZN to benefit from both technologies. I treated this
        library as if it was an open source project, generously documenting it and
        gathering feedback from users in order to improve it. Three of the teams now
        use it in their apps.
    technologies:
      - React
      - Mobx and Mobx-state-tree
      - Webpack
      - AWS Lambda
      
  - name: One per Page
    client: HM Courts and Tribunal Service
    from: Oct 2017
    to: Mar 2018
    duration: 5 months
    statement:
      - >
        As Lead Maintainer, I built and released an open source library that
        makes building the "One question per page" style services easier.
      - >
        I drew on my previous experience with Apply for Divorce and Register to
        Vote to solve the hard problems involved with One per Page transactions.
      - >
        In developing this framework I put a lot of effort in to researching
        with real users, gathering their feedback to ensure that the interfaces
        I designed were easy to understand and flexible enough to customise to
        their need.

    statement:
      - >
        As Technical Lead, I led a team in the development of the Apply for
        Divorce service. Starting from discovery of the problem space through to
        release and iteration of a successful Private Beta, I shaped the
        technical design and pushed for constantly better software and software
        delivery.
      - >
        In order to prevent blocking the team while we hired more Ops staff, I
        worked with a fellow Tech Lead in building and advocating for more
        reliable, automated, Infrastructure. Together we reinvigorated the
        programme's Ops team and brought more modern release practices to the
        development pipeline.

    duration: 1 year, 8 months
    statement:
      - >
        As Technical Lead, I led a 7 person team in the development of the
        Sign your Mortgage service. The team comprised of a mix of contractors
        and Civil Servants, who were in the process of learning new technologies
        and modernising the Land Registry's product delivery.
      - >
        I closely mentored the Civil Servants in my team, through pair
        programming and workshops, to help them gain skill in the tech we
        were working in as ultimately they would own the service once complete.
      - >
        I designed the system architecture iteratively based on discussions with
        the Product Owner and investigation of the requirements with Land
        Registry subject matter experts.

    statement:
      - >
        Durating the initial Alpha of the Register to Vote service I worked as
        a developer in building the service collaboratively with Design and
        Research.
      - >
        After Alpha the team split in two, with half focusing on the backend
        service and the other half focusing on the frontend user journey. On
        that team I stepped in to act as a Lead Developer for the Frontend,
        designing the component architecture for the Frontend app and
        implementing a significant amount of the components.
      - >
        I worked closely with the Designer and Researcher to ensure that the app
        held to the best experience possible for the user.
