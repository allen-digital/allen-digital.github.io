experience:
  - name: Collections 2.0
    client: Times Higher Education
    from: Aug 2021
    to: Sep 2024
    duration: 3 years, 2 months
    statement:
      - >
        I joined THE to lead on replacing an aging data capture system, which
        underpins the company's primary revenue stream. Collections 2.0 would
        allow the THE Data team to self serve using a WYSIWYG visual editor,
        reducing the cost of creating new collections, removing inter-team
        dependencies and handovers, and enabling THE to gather more data each
        year, driving growth in the Data Products revenue.

      - >
        As a growth critical project, Collections 2.0 involved senior
        stakeholders from every side of the business. A significant part of my
        role was to negotiate for mutually good outcomes between the various,
        sometimes conflicting, stakeholder needs, our Engineering teams expected
        quality and operability standards, and the time and cost implications of
        the project plan.

      - >
        My hiring was part of the Engineering organisation growth from a handful
        of scrappy engineers.  I was empowered by our CTO to set the base
        standard for new services and drive changes through the team that would
        level up every project. In this role I focused on tooling modernisation,
        taking the our teams away from hand-rolled CI and Auth systems to modern
        SAAS products, and introducing modern software development practices
        such as Continuous Delivery and Incident Management.

      - >
        Through the introduction of automated linters, modernisation of tooling,
        and DORA metrics gathering, I provided management with the evidence
        needed to calm fears around Continuous Delivery. As a result our
        production deployments went from once a month, with weeks of manual QA
        as a quality gate and a change fail rate above 50%, to multiple times a
        week with a change fail rate below 0.5%.

        My daughter was born during the second COVID lockdown. Working on a
        startup during "the event" led me to miss her early moments.

      - >
        I highly value sharing parental responsibilities and so I left Kantan in
        April to spend 3 months dedicated to caring for her before starting a
        new position.

        Kantan was a startup aiming to become the "OS for Tradespeople". Funded
        by the OVO Group, they are a small team helping trade professionals work
        smarter.

      - >
        As one of the early hires I took a leadership role in planning and
        prioritising work, improving code quality and helping our team work
        smarter. I focused on shaping an inclusive culture and improving our
        systems and tools to unlock the potential of our small team.

      - >
        From day 1 I took ownership of hard problems, such as a system for
        dynamic job sheets, designing our solution and splitting it up into
        incremental improvements so our team could implement a minimum
        releasable feature as soon as possible.

      - >
        I'm very proud of the effort my team and I put in to Kantan, delivering
        a product that our users love against incredibly tight timescales.

        Working as part of a cross-discipline team, I led the creation of a new
        Content Editor based on the Prosemirror library and React. During
        initial development I focused on proving the teams main requirements of
        a simple user interface, interactive components (to allow customisation
        of content), and multi-user collaboration.

      - >
        As Prosemirror's interfaces are quite complicated and the library was
        unknown to the team I built abstractions to integrate Prosemirror with
        the more familiar world of React. This allowed the team to build
        powerful interactive components into the editing surface.

      - >
        After initial implementation and a successful switch of all users to the
        new Prosemirror editor, I worked on building a powerful version
        management system that allowed users to track contributions to an
        article, compare differences between each version and roll back
        undesired changes.

        As a Senior React Developer, I worked with a 4 developer team to build
        the MyAccount section of DAZNs new streaming platform. I took the lead
        on building a library that integrated MobX with React-router. I treated
        this library as if it was an open source project, generously documenting
        it and gathering feedback from users in order to improve it.
      - >
        Having demonstrated to DAZN that I had a knack for finding and fixing
        platform level issues I was asked to join the Core team, who are
        responsible for DAZNs code delivery platform. Here I implemented changes
        that dramatically reduce integration failures, reduced merge-to-deploy
        cycle time from 50 mins to 3 mins, and improved developer feedback
        loops.

        their need.
